A few quick notes about this project:
With my 3-year-old out of school due to COVID, I completed this project quickly, and as such, didn't implement absolutely everything I wanted to.
Things that remain incomplete:
* Refresh Tokens have not been implemented. After about 15 minutes you'll likely be prompted to sign in again.
* Docstrings are lackluster. Most don't follow Google spec and just provide a simple explaination for the class or method.
* It's not pretty. I ran out of time to style the front end. It's usable, but not gorgeous.
* I'm sure you'll find a bug or two depending how long you poke at it.

Thank you so much for your consideration. I thoroughly enjoyed implementing this project. It gave me the option to use technologies I'm not all that familiar with. Flask and GraphQL are largely new to me and I learned a lot.
